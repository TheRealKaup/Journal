# Kaup's Public Journal

I upload here my essays (some in Hebrew, some in English), provided as source Typst and compiled PDF. License is specified per file. `"draft/"` contains essays expected to undergo significant changes (e.g. in approache and argumentation) until considered complete enough to be moved to `"release/"`, which may still see there minor changes (e.g. in wording and typography).

If you encounter errors, regardless of their magnitude, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could submit a GitHub issue.
